# StacksOS World-Class Mega Checklist (Deprecated)

This document is intentionally **deprecated** and kept only to preserve older links.

The single source of truth for scope + status is:
- `docs/StacksOS-Execution-Backlog.md`

Operational docs:
- `docs/StacksOS-Runbook.md`
- `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`

Quality gates:
- `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 ./audit/run_all.sh` (writes `audit/REPORT.md`, `audit/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`, `audit/REPO_INVENTORY.md`)

If you want to add additional “world-class” requirements, add them to `docs/StacksOS-Execution-Backlog.md` under P2 with clear acceptance criteria.
